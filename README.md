# FinalSwimProject

The goal was to explore deeper into how some the top swimmers in the World compare to the World record holder. We found that for those who didn't current hold a record, the rest of the field was quite far away from where they would need to be to break the record. We also found that in the women's field especially, the distance between the two far exceeded the men. The men were more closely connected than the women.
